//Game Logic
//make case insensitive: CHECK
//create intro
  -Ask name
  -Select starter pokemon
  -instructions and prompt to start adventure
//create scene between battle
  -game automatically prints "Searching for Adventure" for 5 seconds
  -Game sees something interesting and asks if you want to check it
  -Will start trainer battle or pokemon battle or item
//Game start
  -Will have the basics of guessing enemy pokemon name while they guess yours
  -turn base
//make random word and guess letters have spaces
//Upgrade the code!

//Game Design
//Start Menu: Will display main character and title
//Intro: to select your pokemon and rival name and hear a basic story
//Start adventure: will start queue for 5 different encounters. One will
  be a Gym fight and last a Rival battle. The rest will be random pokemon
  encounters.
//Trainer will have only 1 life per pokemon owned. Pokemon dies off when you lose
  a round and your next pokemon is used. 0 pokemon loses game and exits end game details.
//Trainer Starts with 1 pokemon and has a chance to gain 3 during random encounters
//gym trainer has 2 random pokemon and gives a cool badge thats displayed we defeated
//Rival has 3 random pokemon and when defeated triggers the completion display
